# Tic Tac Toe

[Live version](https://jasonpompon.github.io/project_1)

This is my 1st EVER project

### Stack
> HTML, CSS and JavaScript

To get a win a player must get 3 consecutive of the same symbol either it is vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

An additional "feature" I've added is a randomly generated set of quotes which is stored in memory in an array.

My approach taken was the separation of concerns where I started to write the logic of the game first. When that was done and working, I start focusing on the DOM manipulation and then at last adding some styling with it.

I tried my best to make it responsive so that it works of smaller screen like mobile phones.

My unresolved problem is I couldn't get the favicon.ico to appear.

#### Future Addition
> Incorporate some sort of AI so one can play on his own
> Ability to change character

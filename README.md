## ticTacToe

This is my 1st project

To do it  I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript

To get a win a player must get 3 consecutive of the same symbol either it is vertical, horizontal or diagonal

My approach taken was the separation of concerns where I started to write the logic of the game first. When that was done and working, I start focusing on the DOM manipulation and then at last adding some styling with it.

I tried my best to make it responsive so that it works of smaller screen like mobile phones.

My unresolved problem is I couldn't get the favicon.ico to appear.
